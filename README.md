# QAhoroscope

Project 2/3 for QA ltd. A simple horoscope app

This project is intedned to take in the user's date of birth/birth month. Via a search box, dropdown menu or both.
Displaying their star sign and giving them a description and a fortune for the day. Ideally the date of birth the user tyoes in will match up to one of the 12 horoscopes
An image of their sign is displayed, in the future these images will be from a pool of each of the 12 catagories and have a random selection of fortunes, even maybe allowing the user to create more
